# Translations for GSam Battery Monitor
This repository holds the English and all translated strings for the GSam Battery Monitor android app.

Interested in translating GSam Battery Monitor?  Contact the the author (gsamtan +At= +gmail dot +com). 

Already a translator?  You should have Commit authority - you can either use GIT or the github web interface to upload the appropriate Strings file.  Let me know when you have an update, and I'll crank a build for you to verify the translation.

# Translator Instructions
 1. Access the repository.   You should have full access once you've provided a github ID. https://github.com/GSamLabs/gsam-battery-monitor-translation
 2. View or download the English version of the strings.xml file [here](https://github.com/GSamLabs/gsam-battery-monitor-translation/blob/master/src/main/res/values/strings.xml).  You can get the 'raw' file to download by clicking on the Raw File link.
 3. Add (or modify) your language specific strings.xml by going to the above [URL](https://github.com/GSamLabs/gsam-battery-monitor-translation/tree/master/src/main/res).  In here you'll see the values-XX (if not, create one).  You can edit the files directly, or upload a file.  *EG:* Russian is located [here](https://github.com/GSamLabs/gsam-battery-monitor-translation/blob/master/src/main/res/values-ru/strings.xml)
 4. You can modify a file directly.  Don't add a new file for every new version, instead just edit the existing one.  Just copy/paste the entire file in again.
 5. If you're comfortable editing / adding an xml file into an existing APK and resigning it you can do that to validate, otherwise just let me know and I'll crank out a build with the latest file you uploaded.
 6. There is a language option in the preferences of GSam Battery Monitor now that let's you override your default phone locale for the app if you want - it's useful for validating the various languages.
 7. The about screen will include a list of all translated languages as well as an optional translators name & HTML link.  If you want to remain anonymous, just don't add the 'translator_XX' string key.  
 8. I'll publish a new strings.xml file every new build of the battery monitor.  I'll pull in whatever the latest version of the translated files are at that point in time.
 9. You can view differences between versions of the English strings file to see what has changed since last translated by going to the english strings file [here](https://github.com/GSamLabs/gsam-battery-monitor-translation/blob/master/src/main/res/values/strings.xml).  Click on the History button, and select the change you wish to see the details of what changed so you can update the translated version accordingly.

###NOTES:
 * If you're familiar with git and github, feel free to use it directly rather than going through the web interface.
 * If it's simpler for you, you can always simply grab the latest English file [here](https://github.com/GSamLabs/gsam-battery-monitor-translation/blob/master/src/main/res/values/strings.xml), translate it as you normally would, and email me a copy of the translated strings.
